# waitee
A minimal YouTube API V3 class written in PHP

# Why
I need a quick class to add basic Youtube functionalities to a Telegram Bot so I came up with the idea of this little class. It doesn't want to be full fledged interface by any means. Feel free to fork it or ask me for a specific funtion.

#Requisites
At the moment the only requisites is the excellent [Httpful](http://phphttpclient.com): a smart HTTP Client Library with a ton of options and goodies.
